## 🔍 Understanding the Framework

The ISO-TDLA-Framework introduces the Théorie de la Dissonance Lexicale Anthropocentrique (TDLA). This theory proposes a new standard, ISO/IEC X-TDLA-2026, which changes how we use vocabulary in AI. It aims to replace anthropomorphic language with metrics based on structural isomorphism and stochastic confabulation.

This framework offers:

- **Lexical Theory Exploration**: Delve into the concepts of language dissonance and its implications in AI.
- **Research Support**: Access articles and research papers that further explain TDLA.
- **Community Contributions**: Engage with a community of users and contributors interested in AI safety and alignment.
